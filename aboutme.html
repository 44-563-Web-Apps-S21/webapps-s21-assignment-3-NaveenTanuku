        Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language.Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple's platforms and Linux.
